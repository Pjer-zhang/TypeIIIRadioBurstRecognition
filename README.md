# Type III Radio Burst Recognition
The automatic recognition of the Type III radio burst using Hough Transform and idea of active contour.

## Method

### Read and preprocess the data

The nancay data is in the form of binary, we developed a Matlab data driver to read in the data. And use the code 'constback\_sub.m' to remove the long-term background

### Binarization

Use several ways to transform the flux intensity data into binary. (get\_local\_max\_map.m)

### Recognition

Use the Hough transform to recognize the time and frequency range of the Type III radio burst (proc\_event.m)

### Identify the backbone

Take the result of the Hough transform as a initail position and iteratively move the line to find the backbone position. The demo code : active\_contour.m

Eventually, we can obtain the centerline of a Type III radio burst.
